**P.S.** is a music track written from scratch using the C programming language.
One single source file includes the synth code and the patterns.
No third party libraries are used for synthesis.
SDL2 is required to output the audio stream.

Usage:
* just play the song: `./ps`
* export to WAV: `./ps -o filename.wav`
